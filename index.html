            - It's hard to imagine modern applications without some kind of
            typing.<br />
            - As we know, JavaScript is a dynamically typed language.<br />
            - But that doesn't mean JavaScript can't be typed.

            The TypeScript compiler can obtain type information when it is
            included in JSDoc comments
            <aside class="notes">
              Even if your application is already old and it is impossible to
              connect TypeScript, don’t be discouraged<br />
              You can softly connect TypeScript to increase the reliability of
              your applications using JSDoc.
